# Hi!

Not a lot of code here; I've transitioned into engineering leadership years ago. Easier to evaluate my work through my writing than the random code here.


💼 I share regular insights and tips on engineering leadership on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/pedrogilcarvalho).

✉️ Newsletter about the good, the bad, and the ugly of engineering leadership at [Imperfect Leader](https://imperfect.substack.com).

🖥 More about myself at [pedrogilcarvalho.com](https://pedrogilcarvalho.com) .

🐦 I tweet sometimes [@pedrotypes](https://twitter.com/pedrotypes).
